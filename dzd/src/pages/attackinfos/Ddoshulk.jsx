            <p>Upon examination of the network logs, it appears that the ongoing assault exhibits characteristics consistent with a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Hulk attack. The Hulk attack is a type of DDoS attack that targets web servers by overwhelming them with a high volume of HTTP GET requests, specifically targeting the vulnerable areas of the server.</p>
            <p>Hulk DDoS attacks can cause severe disruption by exhausting server resources, consuming bandwidth, and rendering the web server unresponsive to legitimate user requests.
            To address this Hulk DDoS attack effectively, it is recommended that we undertake the following actions:</p>

            <p>1. Activate DDoS Mitigation Services:</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Engage with DDoS mitigation service providers to deploy specialized solutions capable of identifying and mitigating Hulk attacks. These services employ various techniques, such as traffic analysis, rate limiting, and web application firewalls, to protect the targeted web server.</p>
            </div>
            <p>2. Implement Traffic Monitoring and Analysis:</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Deploy traffic monitoring tools that can detect and analyze patterns of incoming HTTP GET requests, specifically targeting the vulnerable areas of the web server. This information is vital for developing effective countermeasures and adjusting web server configurations to mitigate the attack.</p>
            </div>
            <p>3. Enhance Web Server Security Measures:</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Strengthen the security of the web server by implementing security patches, updates, and hardening measures. This includes securing the web server software, disabling unnecessary services, and implementing access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
            </div>
            <p>4. Utilize Load Balancers and Caching Mechanisms:</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Employ load balancers and caching mechanisms to distribute incoming traffic and alleviate the impact of the Hulk attack. Load balancers help distribute the requests across multiple servers, while caching mechanisms serve static content, reducing the load on the web server.</p>
            </div>
        </div >
