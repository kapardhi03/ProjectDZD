            <p>Upon examination of the network logs, it appears that the ongoing assault exhibits characteristics consistent with a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) SlowHTTPTest attack. SlowHTTPTest is a type of DDoS attack that targets web servers by exploiting the vulnerability in HTTP protocol's design, specifically by sending partial HTTP requests that keep the server's resources tied up for an extended period.</p>
            <p>SlowHTTPTest DDoS attacks can cause significant disruption by exhausting server resources, occupying available connections, and delaying legitimate user requests, ultimately leading to a denial of service.
            To address this SlowHTTPTest DDoS attack effectively, it is recommended that we undertake the following actions:</p>

            <p>1. Implement DDoS Mitigation Services:</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Engage with DDoS mitigation service providers to deploy specialized solutions capable of identifying and mitigating SlowHTTPTest attacks. These services utilize techniques such as request rate limiting, traffic analysis, and anomaly detection to protect the targeted web server.</p>
            </div>
            <p>2. Configure Web Server Timeouts:</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Adjust the web server's timeout settings to ensure that idle connections are closed within a reasonable time. By implementing shorter timeout values, the impact of SlowHTTPTest attacks can be minimized, as the attacker's partial requests will be terminated quickly.</p>
            </div>
            <p>3. Implement Connection Limits:</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Configure the web server or load balancer to enforce connection limits for each client or IP address. By limiting the number of concurrent connections from a single source, the server's resources can be protected from being tied up by SlowHTTPTest attack requests.</p>
            </div>
            <p>4. Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):</p>
            <div style={Style.intext}>
                <p>Utilize WAFs to filter and block malicious SlowHTTPTest attack traffic targeting the web applications. WAFs can detect and block slow and partial requests, preventing them from consuming server resources and impacting the availability of the web server.</p>
            </div>
